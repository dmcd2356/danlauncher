Graphical user interface for instrumenting a jar file with danalyzer. It allows the user to 
 provide an input value to test, then run the instrumented jar file and collect the cost in
 terms of instrumented instructions executed. If parameters were marked as symbolic, it then
 allows the user to run the solver to solve for new paths and provides the bytecode for a
 selected method to view which paths have been explored and the corresponding cost for each.
